Yes, both the Program.cs file and the appsettings.json file play important roles in connecting your ASP.NET Core application to a database. Let's break down what each file does:

Program.cs File
In the Program.cs file, you configure services and middleware for your application. The line you provided is used to register the CompanyContext with the dependency injection container and configure it to use SQL Server with a connection string.

Explanation:
builder.Services.AddDbContext<CompanyContext>(options =>
options.UseSqlServer(builder.Configuration.GetConnectionString("DefaultConnection")));

•  builder.Services.AddDbContext<CompanyContext>: This registers the CompanyContext as a service in the dependency injection container.

•  options => options.UseSqlServer(...): This configures the CompanyContext to use SQL Server as the database provider.

•  builder.Configuration.GetConnectionString("DefaultConnection"): This retrieves the connection string named "DefaultConnection" from the configuration (typically from appsettings.json).

appsettings.json File
The appsettings.json file is used to store configuration settings for your application, including connection strings. It is a JSON file that can be easily read and modified.

Explanation:
{
"ConnectionStrings": {
"DefaultConnection": "Data Source=(localdb)\\MSSQLLocalDB;Initial Catalog=Company;Integrated Security=True;Connect Timeout=30;Encrypt=False;Trust Server Certificate=False;Application Intent=ReadWrite;Multi Subnet Failover=False"
}
}


•  "ConnectionStrings": This section contains connection strings for your application.

•  "DefaultConnection": This is the name of the connection string. It can be referenced in your code to retrieve the actual connection string value.

•  Connection String Value: "Data Source=(localdb)\\MSSQLLocalDB;Initial Catalog=Company;Integrated Security=True;Connect Timeout=30;Encrypt=False;Trust Server Certificate=False;Application Intent=ReadWrite;Multi Subnet Failover=False": This is the actual connection string that specifies the database server, database name, and other connection settings.

How They Work Together
1. 
appsettings.json: Stores the connection string under the "ConnectionStrings" section with the name "DefaultConnection".
2. 
Program.cs: Reads the connection string from appsettings.json using builder.Configuration.GetConnectionString("DefaultConnection") and uses it to configure the CompanyContext to connect to the SQL Server database.

Summary
•  appsettings.json: Stores configuration settings, including connection strings.

•  Program.cs: Configures services and middleware, including setting up the DbContext with the connection string from appsettings.json.

Both files are essential for setting up and configuring the database connection in an ASP.NET Core application. Does this help clarify their roles? Let me know if you have any more questions!





is this only make database connection in asp.net mvc   using OnConfiguring()?

protected override void OnConfiguring(DbContextOptionsBuilder optionsBuilder)
        {
            // Configuring the connection string to use a SQL Server database.
            // UseSqlServer is an extension method that configures the context to connect to a SQL Server database.
            optionsBuilder.UseSqlServer(@"Server=LAPTOP-6P5NK25R\SQLSERVER2022DEV;Database=EFCoreDB1;Trusted_Connection=True;TrustServerCertificate=True;");
        }



Using the OnConfiguring method to set up the database connection is one way to configure the DbContext in an ASP.NET MVC application, but it's not the only way. Here are a few different methods you can use to configure the database connection:

1. OnConfiguring Method
As you've shown, you can override the OnConfiguring method in your DbContext class to set the connection string directly:

protected override void OnConfiguring(DbContextOptionsBuilder optionsBuilder)
{
optionsBuilder.UseSqlServer(@"Server=LAPTOP-6P5NK25R\SQLSERVER2022DEV;Database=EFCoreDB1;Trusted_Connection=True;TrustServerCertificate=True;");
}

2. Dependency Injection in Program.cs
In an ASP.NET Core application, it's common to configure the DbContext using dependency injection in the Program.cs file:

builder.Services.AddDbContext<CompanyContext>(options =>
options.UseSqlServer(builder.Configuration.GetConnectionString("DefaultConnection")));

This approach is preferred in ASP.NET Core applications because it integrates well with the dependency injection system and allows for easier configuration management.

3. Configuration in Startup.cs (ASP.NET Core)
In older versions of ASP.NET Core, you might configure the DbContext in the Startup.cs file:

public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
services.AddDbContext<CompanyContext>(options =>
options.UseSqlServer(Configuration.GetConnectionString("DefaultConnection")));
}

4. Using appsettings.json
Storing the connection string in the appsettings.json file and retrieving it in the Program.cs or Startup.cs file is a common practice:

appsettings.json
{
"ConnectionStrings": {
"DefaultConnection": "Data Source=(localdb)\\MSSQLLocalDB;Initial Catalog=Company;Integrated Security=True;Connect Timeout=30;Encrypt=False;Trust Server Certificate=False;Application Intent=ReadWrite;Multi Subnet Failover=False"
}
}

Program.cs or Startup.cs
builder.Services.AddDbContext<CompanyContext>(options =>
options.UseSqlServer(builder.Configuration.GetConnectionString("DefaultConnection")));

Summary
•  OnConfiguring Method: Directly configures the DbContext within the class itself.

•  Dependency Injection: Configures the DbContext using dependency injection in Program.cs or Startup.cs, often with connection strings stored in appsettings.json.

Each method has its use cases, and the choice depends on the specific requirements and architecture of your application. Using dependency injection and configuration files is generally more flexible and maintainable, especially for larger applications.
