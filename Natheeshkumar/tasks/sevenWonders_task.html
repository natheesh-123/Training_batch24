        <p>
            The Taj Mahal, also translated as ‘Crown of the Palace’, is an ivory white-marble mausoleum built between
            1632 to 1648. It was commissioned by the Mughal Emperor, Shah Jahan to house the tomb of his beloved wife,
            Mumtaz Mahal. The Taj Mahal is often recognized as an architectural achievement of the Mughal Empire. To
            build this ravishing piece of art, around 20,000 artisans were employed and it took 16 long years to
            complete the construction. The Taj Mahal is rightly regarded as the masterpiece of the artwork and its
            construction reflects an ultimate fusion of the Mughal and the traditional Persian art.

        <p>
            Also known as the Flavian Amphitheater, The Colosseum is next in the list of New Seven Wonders of the World.
            This amphitheater is a great example of the Roman Empire’s architectural feat. This monument was built
            between A.D. 72 and A.D. 80. It was commissioned by the emperor Vespasian and was completed by his successor
            Titus.

        <img src="../assets/images/Chichen-Itza.jpg" alt="Taj-Mahal">

        <p>
            Chichén Itzá was a powerful city during the Terminal Classic Period built by the Maya people. It was during
            800 A.D. to 1200 A.D. when this city was a popular trading center for cloth, honey, salt and slaves. During
            the Mayan civilization, Chichén Itzá was an economic and political hub. It was in the 16th century when the
            Spanish abandoned this city. Later, in the early 19th century, archaeological excavations started here. El
            Caracol, an astronomical observatory of the Mayan civilization is one of the most interesting sites here.

        <img src="../assets/images/Christ-The-Redeemer-statue.jpg" alt="Taj-Mahal">

        <p>
            Out of all the new Seven Wonders of the World, the Christ the Redeemer statue is the most recent one. This
            125 feet tall Art Deco representation of Lord Jesus stands on the Corcovado mountain, located in Rio de
            Janeiro, Brazil. Constructed between 1922 and 1931, the Christ the Redeemer is today a symbol of
            Christianity across the globe. It is made of reinforced concrete and soapstone, and weights 6,35,000
            kilograms. The construction cost of this giant statue was around $2,50,000, most of which was raised through
            donations. Brazilian engineer Heitor da Silva Costa, French sculptor Paul Landowski and Albert Caquot
            created this Wonder.

        <img src="../assets/images/Great-Wall-of-China.jpg" alt="Taj-Mahal">

        <p>
            The Great Wall of China was built between 220 B.C. to A.D. 1644 by various emperors and dynasties.
            Historians say that it took around 1800 years in constructing this wall, and it is basically a fortification
            of materials like stone, tamped earth, brick, wood etc. to secure the Chinese Empire from Mongol invasions.
            The Great Wall of China is actually a number of multiple walls overlapping each other that stretch
            approximately 21,196 kms. from east to west of China. Regarded as the longest man-made structure, the Great
            Wall of China passes through mountains, plateaus, grasslands and deserts.

        <h2>Machu-Picchu</h2>
        <img src="../assets/images/Machu-Picchu.jpg" alt="Taj-Mahal">

        <p>
            Machu Picchu is an Incan fortified city of the pre-Columbian era, located above the Sacred Valley, on the
            eastern slopes of the Andes range. As per archaeologists, it was built in 1438-1472 as an estate for
            Pachacuti, the Incan emperor. Later, at the time of Spanish Conquest, this city was abandoned. Until 1911,
            it was not a known site except to the locals, when an American historian, Hiram Bingham, brought it to the
            global attention. This site was built in the classical Inca style and had polished dry-stone walls. You can
            reach this place only by train, helicopter or foot. The Peruvian government has lately limited the amount of
            time tourists can spend here in order to preserve this site.
