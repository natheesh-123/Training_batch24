WebDriver setup
1.Install jdk latest version
2.Install eclipse Latest edition
3.Install WebDriver from files from selenium website.
4.Configure Eclipse with WebDriver(selenium dependency latest).

1.Create a maven project
2.src/main/java folder - create a class (LoginPage) with main function under default package.
3.Import selenium inside maven project.
a)add dependency in pom.xml file
b)add jars in the maven project.  

Add jars - Download seleniumjar (from selenium website Java, extract zip file)
Right click on maven project->build path->configure build path->In Libraries->Add external jars->Apply ->Apply & Save

WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver();
		
		driver.get("http://quiz-fe-test.hematitecorp.com/");
		
		WebDriver driver1 = new FirefoxDriver();
		
		driver1.get("http://quiz-fe-test.hematitecorp.com/");
 
System.out.println(driver1.getTitle());
		
		System.out.println(driver1.getCurrentUrl());
		
		System.out.println(driver1.getPageSource());
		
		driver1.close();
 
WebDriver driver = new EdgeDriver();
 

driver1.navigate().to("http://hematiteweb.hematitecorp.com/");
		
		driver1.navigate().back();
		
		driver1.navigate().forward();
		
		driver1.navigate().refresh();
		
		driver1.manage().window().maximize();
		
		driver1.manage().window().minimize();
		
		driver1.manage().window().setSize(new Dimension(1024,768)); //import from selenium
		
//		driver1.switchTo().alert();
		
//		driver1.manage().getCookies();
 


Task 1: Write down the testcases to test QuizApp url: is opening on multiple browsers,
anlong with test its title, pagesource, currenturl, try to open a new website(any) in another tab, manage the window.
 
Note: use multiple pre-defined functions for webdriver automation testing.


Hello everyone, can you please tell me in covered tools where you are facing issues? so that in these three days i can 
take your complete practice.
 
Important is unit testcases and api testing. are able to write unit testcases with junit? api testing ?
 

OWASP ZAP Tutorial : -
Zed Attack Proxy(ZAP)
Notes: https://www.zaproxy.org/getting-started/
What is ZAP?
A tool to find vulnerabilities in a Web Application.
It is Open Source and completely FREE
Cross Platform â€“ Windows, Linux and Macs
 
Features:
1.Intercepting Proxy
2.Spider
3.Passive Scan
4.Active Scan
5.Fuzzing
6.Reports
7.ZAP Extensions
8.Dynamic SSL Certificates
 
https://www.zaproxy.org/download/
 

2: ZAP Installing Dynamic SSL Certificate.
Step 1: Open the OWASP ZAP Tool
Step 2: Click on no, I do not want to persist the session of now
             Click on Remember my choice.

Step 3: Go to Tools options-----ðŸ¡ªOptions--ðŸ¡ªDynamic SSL Certificate -ðŸ¡ªSave it--ðŸ¡ªSelect a folderðŸ¡ªcancle/ok
 
Step 3: Go to Tools options-----ðŸ¡ªOptions--ðŸ¡ªNetwork->server certificate->Dynamic SSL Certificate -ðŸ¡ªSave it--ðŸ¡ªSelect a folderðŸ¡ªcancle/ok
 
Step 4: Close the OWASP ZAP tool and open Firefox browser
Go to setting------ðŸ¡ªprivacy and security -----ðŸ¡ªview certificates
---ðŸ¡ªimport button-ðŸ¡ªselect the folderðŸ¡ªadd certificateðŸ¡ªtrusted certificate click itðŸ¡ªimport it successfully 
 
Same as JMeter import the certificates and you can import certificate for other browsers as well.
This is necessary so that you can navigate to various applications/website in zap 

1.Intercepting Proxy
Browser -----------ðŸ¡ªOWASP ZAP-------------ðŸ¡ªWeb Application.
 
Step 1: Open OWASP ZAP Tool-----ðŸ¡ªAt footer proxy port 8080 will be started,-ðŸ¡ªGo to options-----ðŸ¡ªtools----ðŸ¡ªNetwork ---ðŸ¡ªLocal Proxy

Configure on firefox ->network settings->Port 8081, HttpProxy : localhost
 
http://quiz-fe-test.hematitecorp.com/
 
admin@gmail.com 
 
Admin@1234
 

5: Configuration FoxProxy with Zap
Step 1: open FireFox and go to network settings-------ðŸ¡ª click to No proxy settings. (Make sure that no proxy settings in on). 
Then open new tab on firefox and type Firefox add on, hit enter----ðŸ¡ª search box : FoxyProxy Standard--ðŸ¡ªAdd to FireFox.

Now open OWASP ZAP Tool and check local proxy settings and as per that settings add data into FoxyProxy extension.
 
Open FoxyProxy extension ----ðŸ¡ªoptions---ðŸ¡ªproxies---------ðŸ¡ªadd ------ðŸ¡ªadd data there.
 
title : ZAPNetwork
 
localhost
 
8081
 

Go to new tab of firefox browser now, open any website, parallel open OWASP ZAP tool
 with that and see no recording is going on but, when you will enable the ZAPNetwork 
from Firefox browser extension then, it will show that Network as well as start recordings also.
 
Extension----ðŸ¡ªclick on ZAPNetwork, Refresh that website again, then it will record all requests.

Actually we are intercepting login request here,
Now here, we are able to see the credential, and if we changed the password from zap tool then, 
your credentials will be changed and you will not able to open the application, this is often
 called Man-In-The-Middle-Attack.
 
Note: Try for the application to which you have the permission , please don't try for anyone else account.


Intercepting Specific Requests with OWASP ZAP
 
Step 1 : Example: Intercepting a specific api request with zap tool.
 
Step 1: Open Firefox browser----ðŸ¡ªenable FroxyProxy ZAP Network----ðŸ¡ªOpen Zap Tool-----ðŸ¡ªOpen hematite 
quiz app on firefox-----ðŸ¡ªOn zap tool, It will start recodring all requests.
 
Click on questions tab : zap tool will record it
Right Click on that request in zap tool-------ðŸ¡ªshow in site tab--ðŸ¡ªright click in site tab on requestðŸ¡ªBreak.

Here If I chaged the String, then in the quiz app the question tab/ api will not work.
And in information window, you will see new tab added that is breakpoint, where you can see all added breakpoints.
 
Note: Do not perfornm practically it will change the settings in Quiz App.
 
 
Manual Explore for Vulnerability Assessment in OWASP ZAP
Step 1: Open zap -ðŸ¡ªclick on Manual Explore option on the workbench
 
Spidering a website with OWASP ZAP
 
*Spidering allows you to launch an automated scan against an application.
*Spider explores by findings links in html pages.
It begins with set of URLs called Seeds
The Spider then visits these URLâ€™s, identifies all the hyperlinks in the pages.
Add them to the list of URLs to visit
The process continues recursively as long as new resources are found
 
Step 1: Open zap tool
Click on plus icon in the information window and click on spider.
Click on new scan, spider dialog window
 
spider:

Exploring a website end to end

Manual Explore, spdiring - exploring, active scan, automated scan
 
1.Passive scan rules define what kind of vulnerabilities to check for in the background.
2.Application Errors
3.Coockie without samesite Attribute.
4.Cookie Domain Script inclusion
5.Information Disclosure in URL
6.Information Disclosure in Comments
 
 Open zap tool-----ðŸ¡ªtools-------ðŸ¡ª
options----ðŸ¡ªpassive scan rules--ðŸ¡ª
Threshold = High---ðŸ¡ªfewer potantials issues will be raised
                     Medium -ðŸ¡ªAvarage potential issues will be raised
                     Low--ðŸ¡ª maximum potential issues will be raised.
options----ðŸ¡ªpassive scanner--ðŸ¡ª Here we can configure if needed, can set max alerts ranges etc

Application which you have developed scan application end to end, take snapshort of progress
scan of application generate report by using zap tool.
